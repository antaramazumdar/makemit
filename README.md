# 🗞️ Wackathon: Web Control & Slouch Detector

**Created for MakeMIT 2026 Hackathon**

## Project Overview
In the world of engineers, this posture is all too familiar. In class, during office hours, in the dining hall, the shrimp slouch is an epidemic in the engineering community. But why do we slouch? Because there is no obvious reason not to! There is no punishment for slouching besides back pain 10 years down the line, until the MakeMIT 2026 Hackathon. Introducing **Wackathon**: The smart chair that fixes your posture in an instant with copious amounts of negative reinforcement.
